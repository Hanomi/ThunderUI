##	The Thunder UI
##
##Minimalistic World of Warcraft user interface compilation
##
##	Info:
##
##The UI is optimised for 1280x1024+ screen resolution.
##Some simple option are configured ingame, other option are configured through editing lua files. 
##If you don't know how to edit lua files or don't want to learn *a bit* lua language - then this UI is probably not for you.
##
##For upgrade version 1.x,2.x,3.x,4.x - need completely reinstall!
##
##	Installation:
##Backup your Fonts, WTF, and Interface folders. Delete the originals.
